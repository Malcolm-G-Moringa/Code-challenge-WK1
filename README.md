# Code-challenge-WK1

## Description
This project is an implementation of three main functions:
1. gradeGenerator \
The gradeGeneartor function takes in a value of a student's marks and logs the equivalent grade to the console.

2. speedDetector \
The speedDetector function takes in a value of a driver's speed. Based on the speed, if the speed is 70Km/hr or below, the function will log that the speed is ok. If the speed is above 70Km/hr, it will display how many points are deducted from the driver's license or whether the license is suspended.

3. netSalaryCalculator
The netSalaryCalculator function is used to log 5 values;Gross salary, NHIF deduction, NSSF deduction, paye and net pay of a person based on two inputs. The two inputs of the function are the basic salary of a person and the total value of the person's benefits e.g house allowance+car allowance.
